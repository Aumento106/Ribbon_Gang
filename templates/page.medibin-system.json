Its open mesh construction prevents dust build-up, while registered looped edges provide a smooth, safe finish that protects staff and packaging. With contents always visible, the system supports faster retrieval, better stock rotation and improved infection control.</p><h3>Durable SteriLoop® Medibins for safe, visible storage</h3><p>The system includes medibins in six sizes to suit a wide variety of consumables. The open mesh design allows instant visual recognition of stock, keeps air circulating and prevents dust accumulation, making medibins an inherently hygienic choice. The chrome finish delivers strength and durability, while the smooth registered looped design eliminates risks of cuts, scratches or damage to sterile packaging.</p><p>Remember to <strong>Look for the Loop™</strong> — the mark of genuine clinical quality, available only through SpaceLogic.</p><p>Medibins are widely used for consumables in wards, procedure areas and PPE stations, where visibility and quick access are critical. They streamline replenishment and make it simple for staff to maintain correct stock levels without unnecessary handling.</p><h3>SteriLoop® Medibin Panels for maximum space use</h3><p>Medibin panels provide the framework for wall-mounted storage, maximising vertical space and keeping floors clear for cleaning. Available in five sizes, panels can be scaled to fit small procedure rooms through to large utility areas. Panels are raised from the wall on hygiene buffers to support infection control, ensuring no debris can collect behind them.</p><p>A compact single-bin panel is also available for use beside hospital beds, keeping essential consumables within reach of staff without cluttering workspaces. Panels can be installed in a wide range of environments, providing a clear, efficient and accessible storage solution.</p><h3>SteriLoop® Medibin Trolleys for flexible access</h3><p>Medibin trolleys combine the SteriLoop® medibins with our STERIRACK® frames, creating mobile storage that can be moved wherever it’s needed. They are ideal for PPE stations, ward resupply or procedure support, bringing consumables directly to the point of care.</p><p>Quiet, lockable castors ensure safe and smooth manoeuvrability, while the open mesh design keeps contents visible and hygienic. Trolleys can be configured as one-sided or two-sided units, depending on whether they are used in corridors, treatment rooms or larger storerooms.</p><h3>Accessories for the SteriLoop® Medibin System</h3><p>The SteriLoop® Medibin System can be customised with dividers to prevent product mix-ups and standard STERIRACK® label holders in 14 colours for fast identification. Dividers are constructed with the same registered looped design, ensuring smooth, safe edges that protect packaging and staff.<br/>Trolleys can be colour-coded with post strips, helping facilities implement zoning or wayfinding systems that make stock management clearer and faster.</p><p>Below you can view demonstration videos of the SteriLoop® Medibin System in action. Medibins, panels and accessories are available for convenient online purchase with a credit card, while our consultants are ready to help if you’d like advice or a complete project plan. Medibin trolleys are supplied through consultation only, ensuring you receive the configuration best suited to your facility.</p>",
